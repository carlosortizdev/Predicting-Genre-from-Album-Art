# Predicting-Genre-from-Album-Art

This project works towards predicting album genre from album artâ€”relevant to artists' decisions and consumers' music choices. It is broken down into two different Jupyter Notebooks: (1) Data Cleaning and Processing and (2) CNN. All data is from the Spotify API and the CNN is constructed using Keras.
